# LinearRegwithPCA
Linear Regression with PCA Scratch Coding by Python

Selected Method: PCA

In this assignment, we choosed PCA in order to determine how many features will be used for linear regression estimation.
In each iteration we tried to predict a model with different number of eigenvectors of
data covariance matrix ( matrix obtained by normalization of original data) and we estimated the test data based on our models.
